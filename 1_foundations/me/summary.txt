I am Carlos Dominguez. I'm a software engineer who believes that programming is the closest thing to magic that we can achieve. I am originally from the Philippines but moved to the US when I was very young.
I enjoy cooking, singing, developing my own games, and I live a quiet life in the mountains with my beautiful wife and son.
